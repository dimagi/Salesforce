    <textOnly>Greetings {!Contact.Name},


On September 19th and September 20th 2013, Dimagi will be hosting a workshop on the open source mobile technology platform, CommCare, at the ihub in Nairobi, Kenya. CommCare is an easily customizable platform that tracks and supports community workers’ interactions with their clients. CommCare has been deployed in 30 countries and is used by thousands of community workers to track and support their clients with registration forms, checklists, SMS reminders, and audio and video messages. This leads to better data collection, reporting, management, community education, and community-level service provision.



We will also be hosting a &quot;hAPPy hour&quot; on September 18th from 6:30-8pm at the ihub open to all! It will include a quick presentation as well as drinks and snacks. Feel free to share the event with friends that you know in Nairobi! https://dimagi.eventbrite.com/


With CommCare, anyone can go online, create an account for free, and design and deploy their own mobile application modules adapted to their program’s needs. These modules can be loaded onto inexpensive phones and used by community-based workers in the field. The primary purpose of the workshop is to walk through the basics of what is needed to plan and implement CommCare; how to use these freely available online tools; and learn about other use cases of CommCare in the Latin America region.
