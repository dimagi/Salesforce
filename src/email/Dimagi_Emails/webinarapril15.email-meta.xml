    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I thought this might be of interest to you or one of your colleagues. Let me know if you have questions. Happy to keep you updated when we have future webinars as well (should be varying in theme...including one specifically for university-driven research initiatives!)

Best,
Christina Jeffrey

Dimagi is hosting two free 90-minute webinars this April about our mobile platform CommCare. This webinar series provides participants with training on advanced technical topics for CommCare.

To join either or both webinars, please sign up here.

CommCare 101: An Introduction to CommCare (Wednesday, April 15th from 2-3:30 PM EDT): We&apos;ll be re-running the CommCare101 webinarwe ran in March for those who missed it. This webinar will provide a general overview of the CommCare platform, including looking at specific CommCare use cases. We will demonstrate how to build and deploy mobile applications using CommCare, and see how these mobile applications function on a phone. The webinar will end with Q&amp;A from participants and is geared for people who haven&apos;t used CommCare before.

Can&apos;t make it? Watch a recording of last month&apos;s CommCare101webinar!


Using Multiple Languages In CommCare (Wednesday, April 22nd from 10-11:30am EDT): This webinar will provide participants with an overview of how to use multiple languages in CommCare. Participants will learn how to add languages to applications (including non-roman character languages) and how to switch between languages on a phone. Participants will also see how to use the &quot;bulk upload&quot; feature for easy translation uploads, and hear best practices from using and field testing multi-language applications.
