    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  


I hope you&apos;re well. Is your team applying for this opportunity?  Human Resources for Health Program:  http://www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=276732  If so, we would be interested in joining the submission team on the ICT/M&amp;E sides.  I realize the deadline is tight (June 22) - but is a great opportunity for you or your partners. 

 Please let me know if you&apos;d like to jump on a call to discuss this week.
