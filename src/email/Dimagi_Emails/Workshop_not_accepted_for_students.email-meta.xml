    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Thank you so much for your interest in the upcoming CommCare workshop in Nairobi.  We received a high volume of applications and unfortunately are unable to accept your application.

We still encourage you to attend the &quot;hAPPy hour&quot; event on the evening of September 18th to learn more about the work we are doing and how we can partner together in the future: http://dimagi.eventbrite.com/

Alternatively, we are also in the process of hiring and are looking for applicants for our field positions in various locations, for more information please check out our website here: http://www.dimagi.com/about/careers/

I would also be more than happy to chat with you any time about CommCare, opportunities at Dimagi, or mhealth in general.  Please feel free to reach out to me at afletcher@dimagi.com if you have further questions.

Thank you,

-Andrea Fletcher</textOnly>
