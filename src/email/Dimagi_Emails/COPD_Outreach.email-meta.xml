    <textOnly>I&apos;m writing to see if you might be interested in an info sharing call to share our work and hear about yours in the COPD/pulmonary health space.

To give you a summary, Dimagi, in collaboration with Boston Medical Center, is refining its ScreenFlow platform an NIH SBIR Phase II grant.

ScreenFlow is a customized solution built on our mobile platform, CommCare.  The tablet-based screening tool combines a validated COPD screening questionnaire, multimedia peak flow meter instruction, and an electronic peak flow meter.  Ultimately, ScreenFlow will be a tool that healthcare staff and research teams can use to drive COPD screening interventions.  We envision it can ultimately be used in a variety of settings, such a patient waiting room or in-between vitals recording and a doctor&apos;s session.

Through a series of five studies, we will demonstrate that the ScreenFlow mobile platform can:

-Qualify and enroll study participants
-Combine subjective (questionnaire) and objective (peak flow) data to identify COPDcases
-Leverage nonclinical workforce to conduct studies
-Save clinicians significant time by limiting COPD conversations to those who are identified as moderate to severe risk level.

We can be easily adapted to meet the needs of other COPD and pulmonary health screening and intervention initiatives, which is why I&apos;d like to learn about your work in these areas.  Dimagi is also exploring opportunities to optimize patient screening and engagement through applying the platform&apos;s full feature portfolio to other disease areas. In addition, platform capabilities like integrated two-way SMS feature could be leveraged to keep patients enrolled and engaged in studies or programs.

Please let us know if your team is interested in an initial discussion around collaboration.


Sincerely,
Christina Jeffrey
