    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},  

Thank you for signing up to learn a little bit more about CommCare and Dimagi through one of our webinars.  Webinars are new for us, so I do hope it was a valuable experience. If you didn&apos;t get to attend or had to duck out early, we do have others coming up next month.

If you have questions about Dimagi or our projects, I&apos;d be happy to organize a demo or quick call.  Thanks again for your interest in our new webinars. Please reach out to me if you&apos;d like more information.  

Sincerely,</textOnly>
