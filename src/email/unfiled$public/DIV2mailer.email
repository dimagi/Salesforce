<![CDATA[<div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Dear {!Contact.Full_Name__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Hope you are well.</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">It’s been a pleasure collaborating in the deployment of CommCare for your organization. Since we recently closed out the USAID Stage 2 Development Innovation Ventures grant, which supported these proofs-of-concept in India, we are pleased to provide an update on the key outcomes of the grant and share some interesting opportunities for continued collaboration with Dimagi.</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Here are some of the highlights:</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><ul><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><font size="2">In just two years, the grant supported <b>58 new programs</b> to start using CommCare, and <b>over 3,100 Frontline Workers</b> (FLWs) have submitted over <b>2.3 million forms.</b><br><br></font></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><font size="2">More and more organizations are deploying CommCare by themselves, and CommCare is being used to support an<b> increasing number of sectors</b> such as emergency response, agriculture, education, and last mile distribution of commodities. Of the 58 new projects, <b>10+ autonomously deployed CommCare</b> without any assistance from Dimagi team.&nbsp;Of the new partnerships created in the first year of the grant, 21% of pilots are scaling-up while another 21% of the programs using CommCare are at scale.&nbsp;<br><br></font></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><font size="2">All organizations awarded with a proof-of-concept were asked to share their CommCare applications on the CommCare Exchange, an open source, free repository of applications that can be downloaded and modified for use by any other program globally -- to prevent re-inventing the wheel. As of now, we have <b>over 45 applications on the Exchange.</b><br><br></font></span></li><li><span style="font-family: arial;"><font size="2">In the course of implementing these CommCare pilot projects in India, Dimagi worked with partner organizations to better understand how to best use mobile technology for frontline programs, use CommCare data effectively for program improvement, and how an organization’s mServices needs change as the project progresses.&nbsp;<br><br>From this learning, we &nbsp;created a <b>Maturity Model framework</b> aimed at identifying and overcoming barriers that prevent information and communication technology projects from delivering value at scale. The Maturity Model helps organizations understand their program’s progress in adopting CommCare along a spectrum of five stages, from demonstration to sustainable scale. The attached two-pager provides a brief overview of this framework.</font></span></li></ul></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Given that we have revamped our pricing based on this engagement model which assesses and maps the organization’s technology needs, we hope to provide a flat 10% discount on all implementation packages for existing proof-of-concept partners as they plan scale up or start new projects. For grantee partners supporting existing projects, and building new projects on their own that are keen to sign up for software plans, we would be happy to provide free capacity building consultations, and help getting CommCare-certified!</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Please let us know if you would like to discuss this in more detail in the coming weeks. We would be happy to set up a call to walk you through the Maturity Model, discuss any future plans you might have in mind for the existing project and brainstorm ways in which the model or the capacity services we offer may be leveraged for your program.&nbsp;</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">Finally, we wanted to make note of the mBillionth awards 2015 (<a href="http://mbillionth.in">http://mbillionth.in/</a>), nominations for which are now open. As you might be aware, these awards are a platform to recognize excellence in mobile innovation across South Asia in categories such as mHealth, m-Women and m-Agriculture. If you would would like to nominate your current CommCare deployment for one of these awards, we would be happy to support you in the process.</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="arial" size="2">As always, thank you for your collaboration with Dimagi.
