Hi {!Contact.LastName},

Thanks for reaching out to us at Dimagi. We are not formally looking for interns at the moment, but do consider applications where the timing works out. Can you send us back the following?

a) When are you available to work on the internship? Are you available full or part-time?
b) Do you have travel funding? A lot of our projects are in remote areas, so this can often help.
c) Your CV
d) Please send us an example of something you have written in the past year: a personal blog, technical report, or anything that conveys your ability to express an idea, make a point, or describe something in detail.
