Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We price CommCare as aggressively as we can and is meant to be priced and accessible to for-profit and non-profit organizations. If you want to use CommCare and cannot afford to pay, you can apply for a pro-bono subscription here:

https://www.commcarehq.org/pro_bono/

Please note that one of our requirements for approving pro bono applications is a demonstration of need.

Best,

Ryan
