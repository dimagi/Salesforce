Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for your reply. I hope all is well!

I wanted to let you know that I can offer you a free 1 hour (or less) consultation call with myself if that is helpful. I have developed and launched a number of CommCare and ICT projects as a project manager and would be happy to speak with you if there is something I can help with.

Just so you know, we are currently offering 5 free hours of consultation time when signing up for a Pro plan, but for a limited time we are offering a 1 hour consultation call for selected new signups.

Let me know if that sounds interesting to you, and if so send over some times that would be convenient to you in the next week or two and we can schedule a call.
