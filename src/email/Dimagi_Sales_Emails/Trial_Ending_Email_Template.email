Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Your CommCare Advanced Trial ends tomorrow. When it does, you will be switched to the CommCare Community Plan.

If time flew by and you never had a chance to build an application, we know you meant well!  Send me an email and we can set up a quick call to understand your needs, to see how we can best support you and discuss options to extend your test period.

If you did create an application it will remain on the server accessible to you, along with the application data.  Note that if you donâ€™t subscribe to a software plan by the end of your trial period, you will lose access to any paying features you might have used during this month. See details here: https://www.commcarehq.org/pricing/ 

If you are interested in continuing to use features like lookup tables or SMS, you will need to upgrade to a paid software plan by going to your Project Settings > Current subscription page on commcarehq.org (https://www.commcarehq.org)

Thanks,

Ryan
