Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

While there is no perfect way to authenticate the data, we have and use a number of tools to improve data controls as much as possible.  We have operational data reports that show when data was captured, when it was sent to the server, and the location of the data capture.  

There is also specific research on this topic - see page 11 of our evidence base for more details, or this paper for the full story. Also our publications page is here for more information.

If you are interested in more details beyond this, I am happy to have a quick call to discuss your needs and can then connect you the right person on our research team.
