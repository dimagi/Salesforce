Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for your note.  This sounds like a good fit for CommCare.  Are there any features that you need that are not included in the Community version? You can see our pricing here.

If you do not need advanced features or have more than 50 users, then you can continue on using CommCare Community Edition. If you need advanced features or have more than 50 users, then you'll need to pay for a subscription, and if you can't afford a subscription you can apply for a pro-bono subscription here.

Let me know if you have questions about the features and plans, and we can schedule a call.

Best,
