    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

I hope youâ€™re having a great week. Our team sincerely enjoyed meeting you at SECONAF Conference, and learning about what you do at {!Lead.Company}.

During the conference, we hope you had the chance to learn more about CommCare Supply and Dimagi&apos;s work in West Africa. Should you be interested in learning more about our mobile solution CommCare, please visit our website commcarehq.org, read about our work at dimagi.com or reach out to me directly.

I would love to connect and learn more about your organization&apos;s work in the region and share with you a bit about more about our work. Let me know if you would be available for a brief phone call.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,

Sarah Sagan
